<p class="h3better">Help Pages</p>

<p>
    Some of the help pages internal to SeaDAS 7.4 have not been revised to match the current version so there can be
    some wording discrepancies as well as feature description differences.  However, we regularly produce video help
    tutorials <b>(http://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/tutorial)</b>.  We feel this to be the best, most functional way to
    enable the user of SeaDAS to get the most out of the software.  In additional we regularly respond to SeaDAS issues
    on the our user forum
    <b>(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/forum/oceancolor/forum_show.pl).</b>  Questions posted on
    the forum help aid us in determining aspects of SeaDAS which may benefit by refinement, as well as give us ideas
    for topics to be used in future tutorial videos.  Also note that these internal help pages are alos made available at
    <b>(http://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/)</b>
</p>


<p class="h3better">Notes on Upgrading your SeaDAS version</p>

<p>
    <b> If you already have SeaDAS version 7 or higher installed:</b><br>
    In your home directory there is a directory titled '.seadas'.  This contains version-specific preferences
    and defaults.  This directory also contains any custom color palettes and rgb-profiles which you may have
    created.  Because of this, a seadas installation will automically move and rename the previous '.seadas'
    directory putting it in your home directory.  When seadas is launched and does not find this '.seadas'
    directory, it will automically create this directory and initialize it with the package settings and defaults.
    You can then manually copy any of your custom color palettes and rgb-profiles from the backed up copy
    of your previous version's '.seadas' directory over into the '.seadas' directory.
