    <b>Release Date: </b> Nov 23, 2015<br><br>
</p>

The SeaDAS development team is pleased to announce the release of SeaDAS 7.3,
which is built atop a slightly modified BEAM 5.0.1 version.


<p class="h3better">Features/ Modifications</p>


<pre>

        GPT operator added
            - Write Image Operator.  This command line operator enables the export of images.  It includes
              parameters for including gridlines, contour lines, color bar, and text annotation on the image.

        Box-tie correction has now been added.

        Color Palettes
            - Chlorophyll Blue-Green palette and scheme added.
            - Palette export now sorts entries in the exported text file
            - User can now remove the default color palettes

        RGB Profile
            - Toolbar icon added.
            - User can edit any of the rgb profile text files.
            - Added 2 new generic rgb profiles (linear and log).

        Filtered Band
            - Toolbar icon changed.

        Reprojection
            - Toolbar icon added.

        Land Mask & Coastline Tool
            - Defaults changed
                * Super sampling default set to 3
                * Coastline mask color set to black
                * Land mask color set to dark grey

        Renamed "Bands (Products)" folder to "Rasters".
            - Rationale: a more simple, generic name - this folder contains raster data which may include
              but is not limited to: oceancolor data products, latitude and longitude data,
              flagcodings, rgb virtual bands, and any number of user created virtual and real bands.

    </pre>



<p class="h3better">Bug Fixes</p>

<pre>
        Version 7.3 fixes the following bugs:
            - geometries could not be exported from a loaded smi image.
            - color bar layer was creating a saved session conflict
            - no-data layer sometimes toggled to top of the layer stack

</pre>



<p class="h3better">Help Pages</p>

<p>
    Many of the help pages internal to SeaDAS 7.3 have not been revised to match the current version so there can be
    some wording discrepancies as well as feature description differences.  However, we regularly produce video help
    tutorials.  We feel this to be the best, most functional way to enable the user of SeaDAS to get the most out of
    the software.  In additional we regularly respond to SeaDAS issues on the our user forum.  Questions posted on
    the forum help aid us in determining aspects of SeaDAS which may benefit by refinement, as well as give us ideas
    for topics to be used in future tutorial videos.
</p>


<p class="h3better">Notes on Upgrading your SeaDAS version</p>

<p>
       <b> If you already have SeaDAS version 7 or higher installed:</b><br>
            In your home directory there is a directory titled '.seadas'.  This contains version-specific preferences
            and defaults.  This directory also contains any custom color palettes and rgb-profiles which you may have
            created.  Because of this, a seadas installation will automically move and rename the previous '.seadas'
            directory putting it in your home directory.  When seadas is launched and does not find this '.seadas'
            directory, it will automically create this directory and initialize it with the package settings and defaults.
            You can then manually copy any of your custom color palettes and rgb-profiles from the backed up copy
            of your previous version's '.seadas' directory over into the '.seadas' directory.
