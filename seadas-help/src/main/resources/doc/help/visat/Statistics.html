<p>
    The Statistics tool enables you to process and view statistics and relevent metadata for any file loaded within
    SeaDAS.  The statistics result can be refined to a particular region of interest and masking criteria.  The statistics
    may be done for a single band or simultaneously for any and/or all bands within a file.  A spreadsheet captures
    these statistics for easy viewing and export to other spreadsheet program.  A histogram and percentile plot can also
    be simultaneously generated.

</p>

<p>This tool is available both from the GUI and from the
    command
    line.
</p>

<p>

    Figures 0 illustrates the results of applying this tool to a level-2 file.

</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Pixels</b><br>This is the total number of "valid" pixels used to calculate the statistics.
</p>

<p class="i1">

    <i>Note: this does not include pixels which do not contain data.</i>
</p>


<p class="i1">

<p class="subSectionTitle">Concepts</p>


<br>


<p>
    <i><b>Regional and Validation Masking</b></i>
</p>

<p>
    SeaDAS enables the masking out of unwanted pixels, so that the statistics can be done on only the pixels which
    meet the masking criteria.  Conceptually, there are 2 types of masking, region-of-interest (ROI) and validation.
    The first type is region based where you have
    defined a specific area of interest on the Earth, and pixels outside of this are intended to be masked out.  Region masking, by
    it's very nature is stable across time and not effected by temporal changes such as atmospheric parameters, sunglint, straylight, etc.
      These latter parameters can be considered validation parameters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>For the GUI:</b><br>There are 2 methods
    by which SeaDAS applies the masks. Y ou may select a mask of a region (or many region masks) within
    the Statistics Tool GUI and these are your ROI masks.  If you right click on a band
    in the File Manager, go to Properties you will find the Valid Pixel Expression and this is where the validation masks are applied.

</p>
<p class="i1">
    If you stay within the rigid constructs of the meaning these 2 masking tool parameters, then you would adjust the validPixelExpression to include
    the atmospheric, sunglint, straylight, etc. parameters
    However, adjusting the validPixelExpression for each band is probably not the most convenient way to run the statistics tool from the GUI.  Instead,
    you may want to create a new mask in the Mask Manager which is a composite of the region(s) and the validation masks (for
    example: MY_MASK = MY_REGION && !STRAYLIGHT && !HIGLINT).  This new composite mask could then be selected within the Statistics GUI
    as the mask to do the statistics on.  Conversely, (but you probably won't want to do this), you could inject the region
    mask into the validPixelExpression.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: when you select multiple masks within the Statistics GUI, it will generate one set of statistics for each mask selected.
        It will not combine these masks together into a single mask.
        </i>
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <b>For GPT:</b><br>Again there are 2 methods by which SeaDAS applies the masks
     but with is a slight nuanced difference when running from the command line.  In this case, relevant to the description above,
    you can supply as parameters a shapefile and a validPixelExpression.  The shapefile automatically loads into SeaDAS, and creates
    the region of interest mask.  If you want to added in validation masking you will need to do this with the validPixelExpression.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: when editing the validPixelExpression to include any custom validation parameters, keep in mind that you are overwriting the
        default validPixelExpression (for example for chlor_a you will want to do something like this: chlor_a > 0.001 &&
        chlor_a <= 100 && !STRAYLIGHT && !HIGLINT).

    </i>
</p>


<br>
<br>

<p>
    <i><b>Statistics and Mapped Imagery</b></i>
</p>

<p>
    In general, it may be best to consider mapping a file one way for statistics and another way for displaying data.
    For statistics you are best served using an equal area map projection (such as Albers Conic Equal Area, Lambert
    Azimuthal
    Equal Area, Sinusoidal, ...). With an equal area projection, the Earth surface area is the same for each resultant
    pixel and can be treated as such with an equal per pixel weighting. However, for large scenes, an equal area map
    projection
    may not look natural so using a conformal projection (such as Mercator and Stereographic) is
    more ideal when displaying this type of imagery.
</p>
<p>

    <i>Note: selection of the "best" map projection is dependent on scene size (is it global, regional, local), scene
        shape
        (does it run narrow north-south, narrow west-east, or is it more square in shape), and scene location (is it at
        the
        equator, at one of the Poles, or some span of latitudes soemwhere between the Pole and equator.</i>

    <b>File</b><br>This is the file to be reprojected and serves as the input file to the Reproject Tool. You
    may
    conveniently select one of the files currently loaded in SeaDAS using the drop down selector. In this case, a file
    reference number appears to the left of the file name indicating that it is a loaded file and not a direct system
    file. To select a file directly from your computer system, use the selector button to the right and navigate to the
    desired
    file. A file selected this way directly from your system will not have a file reference number displayed next to it.
</p>

<p class="i1">

    <i>Note: a loaded file can differ from a system file (even though they may bear the same name) in that you may have

    <i>Figure 2. Map Projection & Settings Tab</i>

</div>

<br><br>


<p>
    <i><b>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</b></i><br>
    There are 3 options for selecting a CRS: create on yourself - "Custom CRS"; select one - "Predefined CRS"; or use
    one
    from an existing file - "Use CRS of file".
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Custom CRS</b><br>
    With this option you will manually select the map projection (along with it's parameters) and the datum to use.
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Geodetic datum</b><br>
    The coordinate system for locating positions on the Earth. In general, these are based on reference ellipsoids used
    to represent the shape of the Earth. You can select from a variety of datums. The most common (and SeaDAS default)
    is "WGS 84" (WGS 1984, EPSG:4326).

</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Projection</b><br>
    The map projection (or how the 3 dimensional Earth's surface will be transformed on a 2 dimensional surface).
    Select from a list of map projections. If a projection requires parameters then the "CRS Parameters" button will
    become selectable.
</p>

<p class="i3">
    <b>CRS Parameters</b><br>
    This opens a window of selectable parameters needed by the selected map projection. These contain default values,
    but likely
    you will want to modify these values based on your scene location or region of interest.
    (See <a href="Reprojection.html#crsParameters" class="invisibleLink">CRS Parameters</a> for a more on these
    parameters)
</p>


</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Predefined CRS</b><br>
    SeaDAS contains a multitude of pre-defined coordinate reference systems including the EPSG (European Petroleum
    Survey Group) Geodetic Parameter
    Dataset. Use the selector to the right to choose one
    of these projections. (
    See <a href="Reprojection.html#Figure4" class="invisibleLink">Predefined CRS</a> for more on this).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use CRS of file</b><br>
    Select a file from your system (one with geo-coding) and use the identical map projection criteria and geographic
    boundaries of that file. This will have the effect that both files are collocated (same raster grid size and grid
    geocoding) but separate files. See the Collocation Tool if you wish to actually merge the files together.
</p>
<br>


<p>
    <i><b>Output Settings</b></i>
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Preserve resolution</b><br>
    Use the SeaDAS defaults which will automatically determine a "best-fit" resolution, output file size, and easting
    and westing.
    You can deselect this and manually set these parameters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Add delta lat/lon bands</b><br>
    Specifies whether or not delta latitude and longitude bands will be added to the target product. These are virtual
    bands, which can be used to assess the accuracy of the new geo-coding given by the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
    with respect to the old geo-coding.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Reproject tie-point grids</b><br>
    Specifies whether or not the tie-point grids shall be included. If they are reprojected they will appear as bands in
    the target product and not any more as tie-point grids.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>No-data value</b><br>
    The default no-data value is used for output pixels in the projected band which have either no corresponding pixel
    in the source product or the source pixel is invalid.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Resampling method</b><br>
    This is the interpolation method. Choose between Nearest, Bilinear, and Bicubic. (<a
        href="../general/ResamplingMethods.html">See details</a>)
</p>

    shifting the geographic boundaries of your output file up and down. (<a href="Reprojection.html#eastingNorthing"
                                                                            class="invisibleLink">More details</a>)

<p class="i1">
    <b>Orientation</b><br>
    This is the angular rotation of the output image.  It is the angle between geographic north and map grid north (in degrees),
    in other words, the convergence angle of the projection's vertical axis from true north.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Pixel sizeX</b><br>
    This is the resolution in the x direction of the output image. The units are dependent on which CRS you have
    defined.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Pixel sizeY</b><br>
    This is the resolution in the y direction of the output image. The units are dependent on which CRS you have
    defined.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Fit product size</b><br>
    This is used to define the width and height in pixels of the output file such that all data from the input file
    will be "best fit" and fully included in the output file.
    Of note and caution is that SeaDAS (as of version 7.5) uses the width and height setting and ignores this checkbox
    when Reproject runs.
    Really the wording on this should be "Edit sizing". We will have to look into this. Regardless, clicking "Reset"
    will set
    these values for the width and height to "best fit".
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Width</b><br>
    This is the desired width in pixels of the output file.
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Height</b><br>
    This is the desired height in pixels of the output file.

    <i><b>A bit more about the Easting and Northing fields and the Reset button</b></i><br>

    The Easting and Northing fields can be a bit intimidating and not so intuitive, however basically you need to ask
    yourself whether
    you want the geographic boundaries of your output file to be adapted to "best-fit" and include all the data from the
    input scene, or
    whether you have a specific and exact geographic boundary for your output file in mind.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    For the former "best fit" case, SeaDAS can calculate default Easting and Northing values based on your scene
    boundaries and
    CRS criteria. To do this, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of this GUI window. Of note is that the very
    first time you open this sub window during a SeaDAS session, the default will be calculated and applied,
    but from that point onward the assumption is that the value in the textfield is the value which you want to use
    If you make further changes to the CRS criteria or change to a different file, then you will again need to click
    "Reset".
</p>
<p class="i1">

    For the latter case, since the false easting and false northing fields also appear with the CRS definition it may be
    better
    or perhaps more clear to set them there and then set the values here to 0.0 for each. Either way, keep in mind that
    the actual
    false easting and false northing is the sum of the corresponding values in the CRS parameters and Output Parameters.

</p>
<p class="i1"><i>Note: Easting, northing and the pixel size are given in the units of the underlying map
    (e.g. dec. degree for geographic and meter for the UTM projection).</i>

<a name="GPT"></a>

<p class="subSectionTitle">Command Line Tool (GPT)</p>

<p>
    The Reproject tool can also be run from the command line using SeaDAS GPT (graph processing tool). All parameter
    options within the GUI are also supported for the command line version with a few minor parameter name differences
    which
    will be noted below.
</p>
<p>
    GPT "collocatedWith" = GUI "use CRS of file" <br>
    GPT "crs" can be either XML or the EPSG Authority (for example EPSG:4326, AUTO:42001, etc.) <br>
    GPT "wktFile" as an input is not available in the GUI, but the GUI can create and display the CRS WKT of the
    specified CRS
    parameters
    which could subsequently be used on the command line. <br>
</p>

<p><i>Note: The GPT Reproject tool also includes the Orthorectification.</i> </p>

<ul>
    <li>Version 7.5
        <ul>
            <li>Major rewrite of the statistics tool (both GUI and GPT) - besides the added parameters, fields and metadata,
                the "true" median is now available.  Previous versions used a quicker binned calculation of the median.
                The current version is now multi-band instead of limited to single band.</li>
            <li>Major rewrite of the help page</li>
