<a name="Overview"></a>


<p class="subSectionTitle">Overview</p>

<p>
    The Reproject tool enables you to take any file (one which contains geo-coding) and resample it into a new file
    with
    a specified map projection. Some key parameters which you can specify are: coordinate reference system
    (CRS),
    resolution, interpolation method, and geographic location.
</p>

<p>This tool is available both from the GUI and from the
    command
    line (<a href="../beam-gpf/org_esa_beam_gpf_operators_standard_reproject_ReprojectionOp.html" class="invisibleLink">GPT-Reproject</a>).
</p>

<p>

    Figure 1 illustrates the results of applying this tool to a level-2 file using an oblique stereographic projection.
    The
    greenish portion of the image is a surface reflectance band and the shape of the level-2 boundary can be seen in the
    projection. Land and water masking has been applies to pixels outside of the original level-2 file boundaries.

<a name="Concepts"></a>

<p class="subSectionTitle">Concepts</p>


<p>
    <b>Valid Pixels and NaNs</b><br>There is not a one-to-one correspondance between the pixels of the input file and
    those of the output reprojected file. To handle this, the Reproject tool masks out invalid pixels and ultimately
    reprojects only the valid pixels of the source file. This hidden automated pixel validation step is acheived using
    the following two
    criteria: the <b>valid pixel expression</b> and the designation of a <b>no-data value</b>. You can view/modify this
    criteria by
    right-clicking on any band, and selecting <b>Properties</b>. Alternatively you can view this with the <b>Band
    Info</b> tool (<i>Analysis > Band Info</i>)
    when selecting the band.

    In general this is the desired behavior, unless the valid pixel expression is masking on an ideal range, outside of
    which there
    may actually be valid data. If you wish to include this out-of-range data in the reprojection then you will need to
    edit the
    valid pixel expression of the band(s) of the source file before reprojecting. One example of this would be when
    creating true color
    images using surface reflectances. Because the surface reflectance product is designed based on water leaving
    radiances for the ocean, pixels which image cloud tops
    can exceed a reflectance value of 1. In this case, for the case of including bright clouds in your true color
    imagery, the valid
    pixel expression band(s) of the source file would need to be modified so as to not throw away values above 1.


</p>

<br>
<i><b>Statistics and Mapped Imagery</b></i>
<p>
    In general, it may be best to consider mapping a file one way for statistics and another way for displaying data.
    For statistics you are best served using an equal area map projection (such as Albers Conic Equal Area, Lambert Azimuthal
    Equal Area, Sinusoidal, ...). With an equal area projection the Earth surface area is the same for each resultant
    pixel and they can be treated as such with an equal weighting. However, for large scenes, an equal area map
    projection
    may not look natural so using a conformal projection (such as Mercator and Stereographic) is
    more ideal when displaying imagery.
</p>
<p>

    (Note: selection of the "best" map projection is dependent on scene size (is it global, regional, local), scene
    shape
    (does it run narrow north-south, narrow west-east, or is it more square in shape), and scene location (is it at the
    equator, at one of the Poles, or some span of latitudes soemwhere between the Pole and equator.)

</p>



<br>
<i><b>Upsampling</b></i>
<p>
    Upsampling is the process of resampling (remapping) your data to a higher resolution. Upsampling has no inherent
    problems,
    other than the fact that the resultant file will be increasingly larger with higher resolutions. A remapped
    upsampled image
    will tend to be clearer than one remapped at a resolution comparable with the original input file. The higher the
    resampling
    resolution, the closer you approach to seeing the pixel shapes of the original unprojected file.
</p>
<p>
    (Note: Ideally a remapped
    image should not be displayed at a zoom level such that it displays the pixellation of the output file. Such a
    visual
    might cause a viewer to incorrectly infer a measurement of noise (or lack of noise) pixel to pixel, when
    in fact
    these pixels do not bear a one-to-one correspondance with the native satellite detector measurements.)
</p>


<br>
<i><b>Downsampling</b></i>
<p>
    Downsampling is the process of resampling (remapping) your data to a lower resolution. Downsampling by more than a
    factor
    of two does have inherent problems, at least in the SeaDAS Reproject and related tools. This is because SeaDAS
    currently
    only offers 3 interpolation methods (nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic which use a matrix size on the input
    file
    of 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4 respectively for the remapping of each pixel in the output file. Downsampling by greater
    factors
    than these matrix sizes, will result in many of the pixels in the source file being ignored. Basically, in order to
    ensure that all source data pixels are being use, if you are downsampling by a factor of 4 then use bicubic, a
    factor
    of 2 then use bilinear or bicubic, and a factor of 1 then use any of the three.

</p>
<p>
    (Note: this sampline concept and process is the same in all of the SeaDAS visualization resampling tools: Reproject,
    Collocate,
    Mosaic, and Time Series. The SeaDAS OCSSW tools for binning and mapping behave differently and do not ignore
    any source data pixels for large factor downsampling)

<p>
    <i><b>Source File</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File Selector</b><br>This is the file to be reprojected and serves as the input file to the Reproject Tool. You
    may
    conveniently select one of the files currently loaded in SeaDAS using the drop down selector. In this case, a file
    reference number appears to the left of the file name indicating that it is a loaded file and not a direct system
    file. To select a file directly from your computer system, use the selector button to the right and navigate to the
    desired
    file. A file selected this way directly from your system will not have a file reference number displayed next to it.
    Note that a loaded file can differ from a system file (even though they may bear the same name) in that you may have
    made changes to the loaded file in SeaDAS and not saved them.
</p>


<br>
<p>
    <i><b>Target File</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name</b><br>This is the name of the reprojected file which will be generated. The default behavior appends
    "_reprojected" to the original filename.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as</b><br>Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF, and HDF5.
    The text field allows to specify a target directory. (Note: if deselected this tool will run much faster as the
    reprojection
    does not actually occur at the time of run. Subsequently when the user opens a band in the reprojected file the
    reprojection
    occurs for that band only.)
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Directory</b><br>Location in which to save file. (Default is the last location in which a file was saved)
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SeaDAS</b><br>Used to specify whether the file should be automatically opened in SeaDAS.

<h4>GUI: Map Projection & Settings Tab</h4>
<p>
    This is a tab of the Reproject window

<br>


<div class="center">

    <i>Figure 2. Map Projection & Settings Tab</i>

</div>

<br><br>


<p>
    <i><b>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</b></i><br>
    There are 3 options for selecting a CRS: create on yourself - "Custom CRS"; select one - "Predefined CRS"; or use
    one
    from an existing file - "Use CRS of file".
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Custom CRS</b><br>
    With this option you will manually select the map projection (along with it's parameters) and the datum to use.
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Geodetic datum</b><br>
    The coordinate system for locating positions on the Earth. In general, these are based on reference ellipsoids used
    to represent the shape of the Earth. You can select from a variety of datums. The most common (and SeaDAS default)
    is "WGS 84" (WGS 1984, EPSG:4326).

</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Projection</b><br>
    The map projection (or how the 3 dimensional Earth's surface will be transformed on a 2 dimensional surface).
    Select from a list of map projections. If a projection requires parameters then the "CRS Parameters" button will
    become selectable.
</p>

<p class="i3">
    <b>CRS Parameters</b><br>
    This opens a window of selectable parameters needed by the selected map projection. These contain default values,
    but likely
    you will want to modify these values based on your scene location or region of interest.
    (See <a href="Reprojection.html#crsParameters" class="invisibleLink">CRS Parameters</a> for a more on these
    parameters)
</p>


</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Predefined CRS</b><br>
    SeaDAS contains a multitude of pre-defined coordinate reference systems including the EPSG Geodetic Parameter
    Dataset.
    (Note: as of SeaDAS 7.5, the EPSG dataset being used is version 7.9.0). Use the selector to the right to choose one
    of these projections. The XML text representation of the selected projection will be displayed and loaded (
    See <a href="Reprojection.html#Figure6" class="invisibleLink">Figure 6</a>). If you look at the XML, you can see
    all the individual parameters which go into the particular projection. You could replicate or deviate from these
    parameters
    if you wish by instead using the "Custom CRS" option and manually setting these parameters. Also note that you can
    use this XML or the authority code when running Reproject in the command line mode.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use CRS of file</b><br>
    Select a file from your system (one with geo-coding) and use the identical map projection criteria and geographic
    boundaries of that file. This will have the effect that both files are collocated (same raster grid size and grid
    geocoding) but separate files. See the Collocation Tool if you wish to actually merge the files together.
</p>
<br>


<p>
    <i><b>Output Settings</b></i>
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Preserve resolution</b><br>
    Use the SeaDAS defaults which will automatically determine a "best-fit" resolution, output file size, and easting
    and westing.
    You can deselect this and manually set these parameters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Add delta lat/lon bands</b><br>
    Specifies whether or not delta latitude and longitude bands will be added to the target product. These are virtual
    bands, which can be used to assess the accuracy of the new geo-coding given by the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
    with respect to the old geo-coding.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Reproject tie-point grids</b><br>
    Specifies whether or not the tie-point grids shall be included. If they are reprojected they will appear as bands in
    the target product and not any more as tie-point grids.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>No-data value</b><br>
    The default no-data value is used for output pixels in the projected band which have either no corresponding pixel
    in the source product or the source pixel is invalid.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Resampling method</b><br>
    This is the interpolation method. Choose between Nearest, Bilinear, and Bicubic. (<a
        href="../general/ResamplingMethods.html">See details</a>)
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Fit product size</b><br>
    This is used to define the width and height in pixels of the output file such that all data from the input file
    will be "best fit" and fully included in the output file.
    Of note and caution is that SeaDAS (as of version 7.5) uses the width and height setting and ignores this checkbox
    when Reproject runs.
    Really the wording on this should be "Edit sizing". We will have to look into this. Regardless, clicking "Reset"
    will set
    these values for the width and height to "best fit".
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Width</b><br>

</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Height</b><br>
    This is the desired height in pixels of the output file.
</p>


<a name="eastingNorthing"></a>
<p class="i1">
    <b>A bit more about the Easting and Northing fields and the Reset button</b><br>

    The Easting and Northing fields can be a bit intimidating and not so intuitive, however basically you need to ask
    yourself whether
    you want the geographic boundaries of your output file to be adapted to "best-fit" and include all the data from the
    input scene, or
    whether you have a specific and exact geographic boundary for your output file in mind.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    For the former "best fit" case, SeaDAS can calculate default Easting and Northing values based on your scene
    boundaries and
    CRS criteria. To do this, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of this GUI window. Of note is that the very
    first you open this sub window during a SeaDAS session, the default will be calculated and applied,
    but from that point onward the assumption is that the value in the textfield is the value which you want to use
    If you make further changes to the CRS criteria or change to a different file, then you will again need to click
    "Reset".
</p>
<p class="i1">

    For the latter case, since the false easting and false northing fields also appear with the CRS definition it may be
    better
    or perhaps more clear to set them there and then set the values here to 0.0 for each. Either way, keep in mind that
    the actual
    false easting and false northing is the sum of the corresponding values in the CRS parameters and Output Parameters.
