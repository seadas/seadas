<h1>About SeaDAS 7</h1>

<a name="into"/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The SeaDAS software is a set of executable tools and an application
    programming interface (API) facilitating the use
    of the data products of a number of earth observation satellites.
    SeaDAS is based on the BEAM software.
    BEAM has initially been developed to support the
    data of the MERIS, AATSR and ASAR sensors onboard the ESA Envisat platform.
    BEAM is developed under contract to
    <a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESRIN_SITE/">ESA/ESRIN</a>.</p>
